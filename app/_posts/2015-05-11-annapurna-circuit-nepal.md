<h3>Planning</h3>
In early 2014 we spotted a really good deal on tickets to India. Most of the time, you have to pay at least 400 Euro to fly both ways, we have found it for around 220 Euro per person. So the initial plan was to fly from Warsaw to GOA, one of the most known tourist destinations in India. We have been planning, reading and talking to people. India does not seem to be the appreciated destination. The only things we have heard were: "be careful", "India is dirty", "It's full of scams" etc. We (Ania) have got scared and started considering going to Nepal instead. One of the ideas was to trek in Himalayas (he world's highest mountain range) for a couple of days and then come back to India, so Ania could fly home. We have started wondering which trek is the best for us, and in the end we went with the flow and decided to go for Annapurna Circuit Trek. This was the longest trek available, but on the other hand, the most picturesque. We wanted to do something spectacular and crossing Thorong La pass (the highest pass in the world with an elevation of 5,416 metres) sounded like an unforgettable adventure, as it's pretty extraordinary to walk over 5 km above the Earth. Most of the treks, you can find all the Internet are at least 12 - 14 days long, and we didn't have so much time. We have decided to try to do it anyway. The decision was taken, we are flying to Nepal. Sorry India you will have to wait!

<h3>Flights</h3>
If you buy cheap tickets you should be prepared for the connecting flights which mean a long journey. Cheap ticket means a lot of flights. We had 4 flights total to get to GOA, and 3 more to get to Kathmandu. We started our journey on Friday evening as we had to go to the Warsaw Airport. In the early morning (we slept at the airport) we flew to Frankfurt, then we took a flight to Chennai in India (also known as Madras). We spent another night at the airport (or near the airport since they let you enter departure hall a just couple of hours before your departure). It was so hot that we could hardly sleep. On Sunday morning, we had a flight to GOA. It wasn't the ordinary flight though. We flew to Bangalore first, where we landed, but we were asked not to leave the plane. People who were travelling to Bangalore left and new people joined. It was like a bus stop but made by a plane. Weird feeling when everyone leaves the plane, but you stay and watch the cleaning team who does their job. During the flight, only the veg food was served. We were given some weird spicy sweets which tasted like a marmalade. The guy sitting next to me told it was a chocolate - nod dude it's not! Unfortunately no meat this time! Finally, we arrived in GOA.

India was hot, we known that already since we had to go from one terminal to another in Chennai. But GOA was a completely different story. I would say it was around 37 - 40 centigrade. The flights to Kathmandu were scheduled for the early morning so this time we decided to spend a night in a hotel to have some rest and see what GOA has to offer. A quick chat with some people at the airport and we had directions to our place to stay for the next 24 hours. Since we didn't know anything about GOA we have decided to go to a place called Vasco Da Gamma (the nearest city to the airport). We could take a taxi for 200 inr, but we wanted some more adventure so we took local bus for 20 inr (should be 10 but when locals see tourist, price goes up), the Indian music was included. We have stayed at Vasco Residency which was one of the cheapest options with AC. The place itself was very shady, we didn't enjoy the stay too much. Vasco Da Gamma itself at this time of the year was not a tourist place at all (I wonder if any tourist go there?). We had our first Indian food, we decided to try dosa which occurred
to be quite good. We went to see the local beach. On our way to home we saw a cricket game - this sport is very popular in India (if you have a free evening we recommend watching the movie Million Dollar Arm).

Early morning the next day we have ordered a cab (as usually for twice as much) and went back to the airport. Two more flights and we were in Kathmandu (with the 1.5h delay because due to the traffic on Kathmandu airport plane was flying around and waiting for a call to land). We were a bit tired but happy for the adventure to begin.
