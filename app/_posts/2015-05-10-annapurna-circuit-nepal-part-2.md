    <h3>Kathmandu Airport</h3>
    Kathmandu airport is really really small. Even my home town airport (called Lublinek) is bigger than this one. Since Polish citizens need to have a visa to enter Nepal, first we headed to immigration 
    counters to obtain one. Unfortunately I have put all my money as well as pictures for visa (you need 2 pictures) to my main luggage. Yeah I now, very smart! I was lucky that Ania was thinking for
    both of us and kept most of the money in her purse. Pictures were not needed as well since there is at least 5 e-kiosks where you can scan your passport, fill some details and at the end take a picture.
    Everything went quite well, we had a visa and were ready to explore Kathmandu. Before leaving airport security will check your baggage receipts so don't throw them away!
    <h3>Trekkers Home hostel</h3>
    We have arranged hostel pickup, because we didn't want to bargain with hundreds of cab drivers. After some confusion we have been able to find our guy (for some reason we were looking for Trekkers House).
    Kathmandu traffic was really mad. Cars and motor bikes everywhere, going in every possible direction. No traffic lights, no policeman, no rules at all!

    We had to get used to that for a while. Many roads were sandy and all the traffic generated huge amounts of dust.

    Finally we have arrived at the hostel in Thamel area. In the evening we went for a walk around to feel a little bit of crowded Kathmandu. We met Malwina and Michal, a couple who have decided to travel
    around the world (you should check their blog <a href="http://wszystkozapodroz.pl" target="_blank">wszystkozapodroz.pl</a>). Since they have done Annapurna trek a week before us, they were really
    valuable source of information. We got plenty of useful tips so we could prepare much better!
