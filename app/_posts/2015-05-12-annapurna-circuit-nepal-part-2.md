    <h3>Kathmandu Airport</h3>
    Kathmandu airport is really really small. Even my hometown airport (called Lublinek) is bigger than this one. Since Polish citizens need to have a visa to enter Nepal, first we headed to immigration 
    counters to obtain one. Unfortunately, I have left all my money as well as pictures for a visa (you need 2 pictures) in my main luggage. Yeah, I know, very smart! I was lucky that Ania was thinking for
    both of us and kept most of the money in her purse. Pictures were not needed as well since there are at least 5 e-kiosk's where you can scan your passport, fill some details and in the end take a picture.
    Everything went quite well, we received a 15-days visa and were ready to explore Kathmandu. Before leaving the airport, the security will check your baggage receipts so don't throw them away!
    <h3>Trekkers Home hostel</h3>
    We have arranged a hostel pickup because we didn't want to bargain with hundreds of cab drivers. After some confusion, we have been able to find our guy (for some reason we were looking for Trekkers House).
    Kathmandu traffic was really mad. Cars and motorbikes everywhere, going in every possible direction. No traffic lights, no policeman, no rules at all - just horns, surprisingly it seems working quite well!

    We had to get used to that for a while. Many roads were sandy and all the traffic generated huge amounts of dust. You may find it harder to breathe and choke as a result.

    Finally, we have arrived at the hostel in the Thamel area. In the evening, we went for a walk around to feel a little bit of crowded Kathmandu. We met with Malwina and Michal, a couple who have decided to travel
    around the world (you should check their blog <a href="http://wszystkozapodroz.pl" target="_blank">wszystkozapodroz.pl</a>). Since they have done the Annapurna trek a week before us, they were a really
    valuable source of information. We got plenty of useful tips so we could prepare much better!
    <h3>Getting to the starting point</h3>
    Plan for today was to get the required permits (one to enter Annapurna national park, second one called TIMS) and reach city called Besisahar where trekking usually begins (if you do not decide to take a Jeep and shorten 
    a trek). Before office opening, we grabbed something to eat and did a small shopping. We have found it quite surprising how difficult it is to find a place to eat in Thamel, as opposed to shops with the stuff for trekking,
    The North Face sign is everywhere. We had to as for help otherwise we would stay hungry.

    Since the place where we could get both permits ran out of forms and we had to go to another one in completely different part of Kathmandu. We had no time to waste since it was 10 AM and the last bus to Besisahar was
    leaving around 1 PM. We took a rickshaw (no not the motor one) which wasn't the best idea since I could run faster.

        <strong><p class="text-center">Slowest rickshaw ever</p></strong>
    </a>

    Anyway, we were on our way to get both permits. 40 USD later (each), we had them both. This time we took a proper taxi to the bus station from where we got a bus. Kathmandu bus station looks a little bit 
    like one in Silicon Valley, you can even catch Google bus :)

    It was too late to catch a direct bus from Kathmandu to Besisahar, so we got one to Dumre which was the biggest city close to the destination. We had to wait around an hour for the bus to start
    but in overall it was OK. We had a couple of stops for food and drinks and one longer to change the broken tire. 
    
    <a data-gallery="trekking" data-parent="#content" data-toggle="lightbox" href="/img/Trekking/bus.jpg" data-footer="On the way to Dumre">

        <strong><p class="text-center">On the way to Dumre</p></strong>
    </a>

    The bus was hot, but not that we couldn't handle it. Somewhere close to Dumre, a group of Japanese tourists got in. Since there were no seats left, they were standing for at least an hour. 
    They were going back to Pokhara from river rafting. We were so happy that we had our places, but happiness haven't lasted long. After bus change in Dumre (we skipped one of the buses since 
    it was so crowded that we were offered place on the roof) we had to stand in one of the smallest buses I have ever seen.

        <strong><p class="text-center">On the way to Besisahar</p></strong>
    </a>

    Finally around 8 PM we were in Besisahar. It was dark already so I have decided to take the room in a first hostel I have found. It wasn't the cheapest one (Ania was complaining for days about the price - it was the most
    expensive hotel during our stay in Nepal).

    So tomorrow we start the trip. Himalayas, be ready!
